# backend

View or switch the selected coding backend.

## Usage

```bash
openbase-coder backend status
openbase-coder backend list
openbase-coder backend use codex
```

## Supported Backends

- `codex`: default native Codex app-server backend.
- `openbase_cloud`: Codex-compatible backend through the Openbase Cloud model proxy.
- `claude_code`: Claude Code backend for Super Agents UI-driver sessions using local Claude auth/billing, not `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

The command persists the selection in `~/.openbase/.env` as
`OPENBASE_CODING_BACKEND=<backend>`, the same setting written by
`openbase-coder setup --backend ...` and read by the local console.
Older installs that still set `OPENBASE_CODEX_BACKEND` are supported as a
fallback.

The backend setting controls `super-agents-mcp` coding sessions. Codex and
Openbase Cloud use the local `codex-app-server` service; Claude Code bypasses
that service for Super Agents UI-driver sessions. After switching backend,
restart Openbase services and recreate the dispatcher/MCP host so the new
environment is loaded.

For Claude Code, Openbase uses its managed `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` at
`~/.openbase/claude_config`. Check and configure that scoped login with:

```bash
openbase-coder claude status
openbase-coder claude login
```
