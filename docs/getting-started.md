# Getting Started

This guide sets up Openbase locally using the `openbase-coder` CLI.

## Prerequisites

- macOS (`setup` and `services` use launchd) or Linux (systemd user services). The `computer-use` CLI is Linux-only for Openbase DevSpace Xorg/DCV desktops; macOS agents use native Computer Use tooling.
- Tailscale, signed in and connected, for iOS app access to the local CLI
- Codex CLI authenticated in your normal user account when using the `codex` backend

The standalone macOS installer bundles Python, the Openbase CLI Python
dependencies, LiveKit server, and the built console. Git, `uv`, and Node/npm are
only needed for source installs, plugin development with React component pages,
or Openbase Coder development.

Local Kokoro/MLX audio is optional. When setup is run with
`--audio-provider local`, the CLI installs the local-audio Python packages into
the bundled runtime and downloads the Kokoro voices and MLX Whisper model.

Optional:

- Openbase Cloud login for the `openbase_cloud` backend
- Claude Code login for the `claude-code` backend

## Install

The preferred first-time setup path is the standalone installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openbase-community/openbase-coder/main/cli/scripts/install.sh | sh
openbase-coder setup
```

For fully local speech-to-text and text-to-speech:

```bash
openbase-coder setup --audio-provider local
```

For source development, run setup in dev-workspace mode. This clones the
workspace, builds the console from source, and uses workspace runtime assets:

```bash
uvx --python 3.13 openbase-coder setup --dev-workspace
```

## First-Time Setup

What setup does:

1. Detects the bundled runtime package, or clones/updates `~/.openbase/workspace` in dev-workspace mode.
2. Writes `~/.openbase/installation.json`.
3. Generates `~/.openbase/.env` (if it does not already exist).
4. Maintains editable `~/.openbase/codex_home/AGENTS.md` and `~/.openbase/claude_config/CLAUDE.md` files, and links shared instruction files into `~/.openbase/instructions`.
5. Symlinks bundled or workspace skills into both Openbase Codex and Claude config skill homes.
6. Initializes the CLI workspace and LiveKit model downloads in dev-workspace mode.
7. Writes Codex app-server defaults such as `CODEX_MODEL=gpt-5.5`, `CODEX_MODEL_REASONING_EFFORT=high`, `CODEX_SERVICE_TIER=fast`, `CODEX_APP_SERVER_URL`, and `LIVEKIT_CODEX_THREAD_CWD`.
8. Uses the bundled console build, or builds `console` in dev-workspace mode.
9. Installs background services — launchd on macOS, systemd user units on Linux (unless `--skip-services`).
10. Configures Tailscale Serve routes for iOS access to the local CLI API and LiveKit:
    - `tailscale serve --bg --http=18080 http://127.0.0.1:7999`
    - `tailscale serve --bg --tcp=7880 tcp://127.0.0.1:7880`

If you do not want the Electron app to run setup commands for you, follow the
[Manual Installation](manual-installation.md) page and run the same CLI setup,
auth, service, and health-check steps from your own terminal.

## Start the Server

```bash
openbase-coder server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7999
```

By default this command:

- Runs Django migrations
- Runs `collectstatic`
- Uses the bundled console build, or rebuilds the console in dev-workspace mode
- Starts Gunicorn + Uvicorn worker(s)

## Health Check

```bash
openbase-coder doctor
openbase-coder services status
```

## Uninstalling Openbase

Uninstall is handled with normal system and package-manager commands, not the
`openbase-coder` CLI. Follow the [Uninstall Openbase CLI](uninstall.md) page to
stop and remove launchd/systemd services, remove the CLI package, then either
delete or archive `~/.openbase`.

## Authenticate With Openbase Cloud (Optional)

```bash
openbase-coder login --email you@example.com
```

This stores tokens in `~/.openbase/auth.json` for JWT-based auth flows.

## Next Steps

- Learn command details in [Commands](commands/index.md)
- Install your first plugin: `openbase-coder plugins add <local-repo-or-github-url>`
- Discover bootstrap commands: `openbase-coder plugins bootstrappers`
- Run plugin bootstrap flow: `openbase-coder bootstrap <name> --params-file <file.json>`
- Review environment and auth settings in [Configuration](configuration.md)
- See all runtime artifacts in [Files and Paths](files-and-paths.md)
- Map backend behavior to the iOS UI in [iOS App](ios-tabs.md)
